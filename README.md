# ten_minute_beeps
This is a simple program that beeps every ten minutes using the hourly Casio watch beep noise.

You will need to paste the file path to an audio file (I downloaded this file, personally: https://freesound.org/people/Pablobd/sounds/492481/) into the program before running it.

I've only tested this on my Mac, so I don't know if it works on Windows or Linux.

## Future

This file is extemely bare bones. I'd like to make a version that just works out of the box in the future.
