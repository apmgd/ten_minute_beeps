# ten_minute_beeps
This is a simple program that beeps every ten minutes using the hourly Casio watch beep noise. It was inspired by [this waitbutwhy post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html) on making the most of the 1000 minutes in your day: https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html

You will need to paste the file path to an audio file (I am using [this file](https://freesound.org/people/Pablobd/sounds/492481/), which is also in this respository) into the program before running it.

I've only tested this on my Mac, so I don't know if it works on Windows or Linux.

## Future

This file is extemely bare bones. I'd like to make a version that just works out of the box in the future.
